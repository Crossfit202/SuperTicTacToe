ASSIGNED TASKS: 

Maxwell: 
Can only select from the highlighted board
universal sizing for everything. (media queries? fixed widths and heights?)

Cross:
reset board button
Checkwin(parameters, 1 board so that it can be used for individual and whole board) function - board notifies you when a player has won the board. 


UPCOMING TASKS: 

- general animation and asthetics. 
- scoreboard displays and counters. "_____ has won" (storing variables with player names)
- universal sizing for everything. (media queries? fixed widths and heights?)
- Save and Load Game Feature (database)
- graphics over a board for a winner
- Could be cool to create a speed simultaneous head-to-head mode. Player 1 and 2 can click whatever they want whenever they want and you have to watch the other person while doing your own thing?
